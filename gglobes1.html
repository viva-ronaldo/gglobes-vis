    <h1>Golden Globe TV Awards Patterns</h1>
    <p>To coincide with tonight's 2016 <a href="http://www.goldenglobes.com">Golden Globes</a> ceremony I've put together some visualisations of previous award data in the main TV categories, in which the same nominees tend to appear repeatedly over successive years. I wanted to find out if the voting patterns show any 'memory' of previous awards; that is, does winning one or more times in the first few nominations make a nominee less likely to win in subsequent years? And at what point in a show's run is it most likely to win awards?</p>

    <p>The results show that there is a compensatory effect in the voting, whereby voters prefer to spread the awards around multiple nominees where possible. Also, awards for TV Series seem to go disproportionately to shows in their first three seasons, possibly as a result of this 'voter fatigue', combined with a typical decline in quality in later seasons of a run. Other interesting voting trends around actors' and actresses' names were also found.</p>

    <p>Golden Globe nominee and winner data for 1972-2015 were obtained from <a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>. The categories of TV Series, Actor in a TV Series and Actress in a TV Series, in both the Drama and Comedy/Musical forms, were included, making for a total of 274 cases, including several ties. The plots are done using <a href="https://d3js.org">D3.js</a>, including the <a href="http://www.dimplejs.org">dimple.js</a> library, as an exercise in learning how to use this framework.</p>

    <p><i>In five of the tabs, a thick horizontal line marks the average win rate or number of wins. Thin lines above and below mark the 90% confidence levels around this average; that is, there is a 10% that at least one of the bars will reach this level purely by chance. If wins do not depend on the x-axis variable, we would normally expect all bars to lie within the thin lines, so if one or more bars is close to or outside these lines, this is a sign of a significant statistical anomaly in the win rate or total number of wins. (For the first three tabs these lines are rough estimates only, since there are different numbers of samples in each x-axis bin.) In the 'By season' tab, a thick line similarly shows the expected number of wins; see the tab for further explanation.</i></p>

      <div id="textholdh" class="textholder">
        <p>The win rate decreases as the number of previous nominations increases from none to four, hinting that previous winners may be less likely to win than those who haven't yet won an award. As a result, the odds of winning for a first-time nominee are slightly better than the one-in-five that would be expected given that there are (usually) five nominees. Win rate increases again at higher numbers of nominations (though the samples are small at 7 nominations and above), but it is not clear yet whether this is due to a trend for multiple winners or multiple losers (see next tabs).</p>

      </div>
      <div id="texthold1" class="textholder">
        <p>Plotted against previous number of wins, the win fraction shows a noticeable dip at 1 previous win, compared to no previous wins. A nominee is thus less likely to win if they have already won once: this suggests that the voters do display a preference for letting nominees have 'their turn' at winning once, but only once. At the same time, those with 2-3 previous wins have a roughly one-in-five chance of winning again (and the rare few with 4 or 5 wins have a higher-than-average win fraction, though the numbers are very small), meaning that there are a group of nominees that manage to overcome the bias against one-time winners to win repeatedly.</p>

      <div id="texthold2" class="textholder">
        <p>A nominee's chances decline as they accumulate previous losing nominations up to three, but beyond this it appears that the win rate increases (though the sample numbers at 6 and 7 losses are too small to give reliable win rates), presumably due to compensatory voting favouring those that have been unsuccessful in the past. So having several unsuccessful visits to the ceremony in the past is no cause for despair for a nominee.</p>

    <div id="menu3" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h2>Golden Globe Wins By Show Year</h2>
      <div id="svghold3" class="svgholder">

      </div>
      <div id="texthold3" class="textholder">
        <p>A different trend in voting is revealed here: wins (counting only the Drama Series and Comedy/Musical Series this time) come overwhelmingly from shows in their first 3 seasons, with the greatest chance of winning coming in a show's first year. This is despite the fact that a substantial fraction of the shows nominated continue for 6-9 seasons (meaning that, in any given year, the expected number of wins by season should follow the green line; though see below). This is suggestive of one or both of voter fatigue after multiple wins in a show's early years, or a decline in quality in the later years of a run. While more than half the shows nominated ran for 6 or more years (perhaps largely on the back of successes in their early years, only a handful won any awards beyond their fifth season. These individual cases are visible in the tooltips for the respective seasons.</p>

        <p><i>The green line is an estimate of how many shows of each season are running at any time, made using the total lengths of all the shows in the nomination list. The line is flat at seasons 1-2 because none of the nominated shows were cancelled after their first season (unsurprisingly), meaning that a given year is equally likely to contain season twos as season ones. The true distribution is likely to be steeper at the low end, owing to the large amount of shows that never make it past season one. So, while the sheer number of season ones running at any time might seem to explain the larger win fraction for season one, it must be remembered that many of these are not real award contenders, by virtue of the fact that they were never nominated. The green line really represents the distribution for all shows that are considered 'a success', as judged by being nominated at some point in their lifetime. In this context, the bars lying below this line at seasons 4-8 tell us that successful shows rarely receive credit in the form of awards beyond their third season.

    <div id="menu4" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h2>Golden Globe Wins By Alphabet</h2>
      <div id="svghold4" class="svgholder">

      </div>
      <div id="texthold4" class="textholder">
        <p>A more mundane trend in voting is apparently revealed when the groups of five nominees in the four acting categories are ordered alphabetically by surname. It turns out that the nominee appearing first alphabetically has a greater chance of winning (28%) than the 20% chance that would be expected if surname played no role in voting. Looking at the 90% confidence levels shown by the thin horizontal lines, there is good reason to believe that this is evidence of a real bias in voting. Presumably nominees are, or were in the past, listed alphabetically when presented to voters, who are unconsciously biased towards the first name they read. In a purely statistical sense, this enhanced the chances of Alan Alda, for example, by as much as 40%, which, combined with the length of his surname (another 40% boost; see next tab), is enough to account for two or three of his six wins!</p>

        <p>Interestingly, the name appearing last in the list also seems to gain a small advantage, at the expense of the nominee in the middle of the list. The third-listed nominee has won on only 21 occasions, far below the expected 35 wins for this sample. It seems plausible that a positive bias could also exist towards the last name that a voter reads, though not as strongly as with the first name.</p>

        <p><i>Where there were more than five nominees in a category, any winners in the last or second-last position were added to the fifth- and fourth-placed totals respectively.</i></p>

      <h2>Golden Globe Wins By Name Length</h2>
      <div id="svghold5a" class="svgholder">

      </div>
      <div id="texthold5" class="textholder">
        <p>The length of an actor or actress's name (including spaces) also appears to have an effect on his or her chances of winning. In the four categories considered, on 27% of occasions (48 out of 176) was the nominee with the shortest name successful, more than the expected ~20% win rate. Whether this is a psychological effect whereby short names appear 'stronger', or something else, I don't know. There is also evidence, though with lower statistical confidence, that the nominee with the longest name is discriminated against in the voting (this nominee is successful on only 15% of occasions).</p>

        <p>The full set of nominees is plotted against name length below, from which it can be seen that the preference for shorter names is a fairly subtle effect. Examples of nominees winning on their first appearance and losing thereafter, including Susan Dey, Mary-Louise Parker, Jon Hamm and others, can also be seen here.</p>

        <p><i>Where there were more than five nominees in a category, any winners in the last or second-last position were added to the fifth- and fourth-placed totals respectively. In the scatter plot below, points are jittered slightly in both the x and y directions to avoid some points being fully obscured by others.</i></p>
