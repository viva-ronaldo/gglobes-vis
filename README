Practice d3.js and web scraping by making some visualisations
  of Golden Globe TV nominations through history.

Published page should use tabs with d3 plot and paragraph of 
  text on each.

Plots:
- Wins vs previous nominations: seems to show U shape with wins
    more likely if you have no previous noms or many, and least
    likely with 4 noms.
- Wins vs previous wins: seems to show a dip at 1, i.e. more
    likely to win with 0 wins than with 1, but then recovers
    for 2-4. So does support the idea of shows 'having a turn' 
    to get one win but one only. Others are serial winners.
    With 0 wins your odds of winning are slightly better than
    1 in 5 (28%), but with 1 win they are only 16%. Back to 1 
    in 5 for 2-4 wins.
- Wins vs previous losses? Does seem to increase for 3 and esp 4
    previous losses, suggesting compensating voting. Numbers are
    too small for 5 losses; no instances of 6+ losses.
- Show wins by season, with line showing average show lengths
    are fairly flat up to ~s8. Wins come overly from s1-3. So 
    many shows continue to s8-9 but rarely win past s5. Only
    a handful of cases winning s6+, recently Breaking Bad.
- Wins by point in run?
